# Azure Communication Service and MS Teams interoperability demo
 
Azure Communication Services(ACS) allows you to develop real-time communication features for your application. Within upcoming releases Microsoft provides interoperability with Teams. Currently ACS and Microsoft Teams interoperability is in "Preview".

Within this simple repository, I tried to understand upcoming features with this interoperability. Basically with this simple ASP.NET Core Web Application(w/React), a user can attend to a MS Teams meeting with voice and video call.

Looking forward for "GA" and try to share as I dig more about it.

## UPDATES:
- Text based chat with MS Teams client is added
- Some UI improvements
